The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for.

As it leaves, it goes into the ribosome where the protein synthesis and copying of the DNA actually happens. In the ribosome, amino acids with the corresponding letters match up to the new copy of the DNA. Stop codons are added to the end and a protein is now made.
11376	5	1	1	?	Four major steps in protein synthesis are the chains such as the electron transport chain. The proteins copy themselves and create amino acids. The chain will continue to make as many amino acids as necessary until it reaches the stop codon. mRNA is the type of RNA that sends a message from the nucleus to the RNA strand so it has directions of what and how to make proteins.
11377	5	3	2	?	After the mRNA leave the nucleus, there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis. First, a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA. The first codon of nucleotide bases on the mRNA match the codon on the tRNA. The tRNA codes for an amino acid. Next, another tRNA connects to the next codon, bringing in another amino acid. The first tRNA floats away, leaving the amino acid behind. The amino acids bond. This continues, creating a strand of amino acids, until a stop codon is reached. Then the chain of amino acids is released.

After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthesize protein based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthesize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthesize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nuclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to receive the amino acids it need to create a protein chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protein chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membranal to exit through a protein channal.

In transcription the enzyme, RNA polymerase binds to DNA and splits the two strands apart.  It then uses one strand as a template for nucleotides to form a strand of RNA.  Then it has to go into translation.  mRNA is used as instructions for decoding.  The ribosome is what makes the protein.

In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome.

The second stage is the mRNA getting his own place so he can start out fresh and brand new. He settles down and finds himself a nice woman mRNA strand and they eventually have some children and live the good life.Stage three consists of the everyday life of mRNA at his work place, basically its just his day as he works and manages his life whether it be personal or business.The fourth and final stage is the overall story summed up and then it shows the family live happily ever after and even has Mr. mRNA thanking the nucleus for not liking him and forcing him to leave and roam the free world to find a better life, a more prosperous and fulfilling one.

12396	5	1	1	?	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placed n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a poly peptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the poly peptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.

Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA. The codon and anticodon bind, and form an amino acid.

12755	5	1	1	?	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it takes the directions it got from the nucleas to the ribosomes. Then enzymes unzip the DNA so it can be copied. Then the DNA that was made is trasfered by tRNA and he transferes it to RNA so that rRNA can put together the nucleotide sequence to make the proteins.
12756	5	0	0	?	mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then it goes to a strand of DNA and attaches to it. It turns the amino acids in proteins. Then the cell stores the proteins and uses them.
12757	5	0	0	?	protein synthesis give the body protein so it can maintain at tip top shape,without this are body could not survive
12758	5	0	0	?	the code has to change.
12759	5	0	0	?	it takes it to whatever place it goes then takes it to all of the other Ryas
12760	5	0	0	?	mRNA goes to the cytoplasm.There, it makes copies of itself.tRNA is made.RNA is connected to a strand of DNA.
12761	5	1	0	?	When mRNA leaves the nucleus after transcription, it then attaches to a tRNA enayme that has the anticodon of the RNA strand that apaches itself and performs translation into a readable source of RNA  for the rest of the cell. While in translation it has multiple enzymes with the amino acid linked to the anitcodon and are connected to the other proteins with peptides. Forming the peptyde chain of proteins. This is protein synthesis.
