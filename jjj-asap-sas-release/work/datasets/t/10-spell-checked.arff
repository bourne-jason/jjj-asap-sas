The Data measured Black as 53 degrees C, Dark Gray as 48 degrees C, Li get Gray 45 degrees , and White 42 degrees C.

However, on the other hand this experiment is n\'t closkey applicable. the doghouse would not likely be made of glass, a nd sealed off from outside air curculation. Also, the sun burns many diff erect gases, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp, in addit ion to being brighter. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles. - a note: You could have interchangeable roofs on the doghouse, one of each color, and circulate them during the year, with white in the summer and black in the winter, and the other two scattered betwe en.',2
